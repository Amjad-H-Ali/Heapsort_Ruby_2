# Heapsort-Ruby

##### Description
###### A sorting algorithm that works by first organizing the data to be sorted into a special type of binary tree called a heap. The heap itself has, by definition, the largest value at the top of the tree, so the heap sort algorithm must also reverse the order.
##### Complexity
###### Time: worst _O_(_n log n_), best _O_(_n log n_), average _O_(_n log n_)
###### Space: _O_(1) auxiliary
